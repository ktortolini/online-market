# Online Market

## _Description_

This repository has a web application that uses
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) along with the `express` and `sequelize` packages in order to provide an e-commerce back-end for the client. It has multiple valid JS (ES6) files and SQL files; the `server.js` file contains the `sync()` method from sequelize for running the application, and the `schema.sql` file contains the setup for the SQL database.

- [Node.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize) External Command Line Interface Module `sequelize`, used to connect to the database, close the connection, test if the connection works, all while logging to the console every SQL query it performs.

## _Installation_

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ktortolini/online-market.git
cd online-market
npm install
```

The client should make sure to use `source` within their own MySQL server (after logging in with their credentials) to set up the initial database contained in `schema.sql`.

## _Usage Information_

After the client clones the repository, changes to the appropriate directory and
makes sure they have the appropriate dependencies, they may type the following
in the terminal:

```bash
npm start
```

or

```bash
npm run watch
```

The client will be presented with a notification that the port has been opened indicating that the application has started and is running.

To organize the store-front there are various classes that exist like `Category`, `Product`, `ProductTag`, and `Tag` for storing the merchandise. For example, the `Category` model was written in `JS`, according to the provided instructions, with the following code snippet:

```js
// defines the 'id' and 'category_name' columns
id: {
	type: DataTypes.INTEGER,
	allowNull: false,
	primaryKey: true,
	autoIncrement: true,
},
category_name: {
	type: DataTypes.STRING,
	allowNull: false,
},
```

Then there are various routes for CRUD operations like Create, Read, Update, and Delete when handling the merchandise. For example, if the client wants to create a new tag for their products, they may use the `Tag` model and call the post route, which is written in `JS` with the following code snippet:

```js
// creates an async post route to await the create() method
router.post('/', async (req, res) => {
	// starts a try ... catch block
	try {
	// creates a variable to store the result of create() method
		const tagData = await Tag.create(req.body);
		res.status(200).json(tagData);
	} catch (err) {
	// responds with a status code 500 if there is an error
		res.status(500).json(err);
	}
});
```

This summarizes the general functionality of this application, but there are some more details provided in the workflow video below. Any client would be able to use this enjoyable back-end and exciting application for their e-commerce needs. Looking forward to the next challenge. ü§ìüìù

## _Credits_

First, the EDX readme file icon on the top was made by
[Ileriayo](https://github.com/Ileriayo) with a link provided below:

Lastly, parts of the `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JS` code were created with knowledge gained through EDX, as part of their comprehensive Full Stack Web Development online program. In addition, I made use of tutoring available through the same program, working with Andrew Hardemon to fix and double check the routes.
