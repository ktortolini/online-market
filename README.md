# Employee Management System

## _Description_

This repository has a web application that uses
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) along with the `express` and `sequelize` packages in order to provide an ecommerce back-end for the client. It has multiple valid JS (ES6) files and SQL files; the `server.js` file contains the `sync()` method from sequelize for running the application, and the `schema.sql` file contains the setup for the SQL database.

## _Installation_

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ktortolini/online-market.git
cd online-market
npm install
```

The client should make sure to use `source` within their own MySQL server (after logging in with their credentials) to set up the initial database contained in `schema.sql`.

## _Usage Information_

After the client clones the repository, changes to the appropriate directory and
makes sure they have the appropriate dependencies, they may type the following
in the terminal:

```bash
npm start
```

or

```bash
npm run watch
```

The client will be presented with a notification that the port has been opened indicating that the application has started and is running.

The back-end connections were a joy to make, but it was also very time intensive. Any client would be able to use this enjoyable back-end and exciting application for their e-commerce needs.

## _Credits_

First, the EDX readme file icon on the top was made by
[Ileriayo](https://github.com/Ileriayo) with a link provided below:

Lastly, parts of the `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JS` code were created with knowledge gained through EDX, as part of their comprehensive Full Stack Web Development online program. In addition, I made use of tutoring available through the same program, working with Andrew Hardemon to fix and double check the routes.
